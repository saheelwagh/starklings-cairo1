why layer 2 ?
trillemna 

types of l2

channels -> way to transacrt outsidse and write fina  val
plasma ->  sep chains anchored to l1
sidechains -> polygon , bridge
rollups -> 
bundling
set of trans on another vm and then finality on main chian
zk rollups vs optimistic

zk used validity proofs

zksnarks vs zn startks

ex how to reveal to blind person that 2 valls of diff colors

cairo is a low level langauge

protostar toolchain for cairo dev

argent is like metamask



cairo programs vs starkent contracts

felt is the only data type of cairo e=fr ev from address to bools
 => field elements -> unsights ints 

math.caro and math_cmp.cairo -> major libraries you'd need

use cairo playground or remix plugin

What is starknet ?

Given a sudoku puzzle, verifying a solution is easier than solving from scratch. If our goal is to convince people of the statement “this puzzle has been solved”, we can save a lot of computation by having 
one person compute a solution and then propagate it for others to verify.
 In this strategy, each computation of a solution becomes a one-time event which does not require replication by society. In a similar vein, Starknet scales Ethereum by 
 
 replacing heavy L1 computation with lighter (hence cheaper!) L1 verification using STARK proofs computed off-chain.



Starknet contracts are (for the most part) written in the Cairo language – A Turing complete programming language designed for STARK proofs.
