Starknet bridges the gap between scalability and broad consensus. It integrates a mathematical framework to navigate the balance between capacity and inclusivity. Its integrity hinges on the robustness of succinct, transparent proofs of computational integrity. This method lets powerful operators enhance Starknet's capacity, ensuring everyone can authenticate Starknet's integrity using universally accessible tools (Eli Ben-Sasson, Bareli, Brandt, Volokh, 2023).


Starknet’s mission is to allow individuals to freely implement and use any social function they desire.



Account Abstraction: Implemented at the protocol level, this facilitates diverse signing schemes while ensuring user security and self-custody of assets.

Volition: Will be implemented on testnet during Q4 2023 will allow developers to regulate data availability on Ethereum (L1) or on Starknet (L2). Reducing L1 onchain data can radically reduce costs.

Paymaster: Starknet will allow users to choose how to pay for transaction fee, follows the guidelines laid out in EIP 4337 and allows the transaction to specify a specific contract, a Paymaster, to pay for their transaction. Supports gasless transactions, enhancing user accessibility.

## Cairo
Inspired by Rust, Cairo lets you write contracts safely and conveniently.

Why Choose Cairo?
Cairo is designed for Provable Computation, a new paradigm that lets programs prove their correctness without re-running them. Here’s why it stands out:

Purpose-Built: Designed specifically for smart contracts.

No EVM Limits: Goes beyond what the Ethereum Virtual Machine can do.

Flexibility: Uses traits for more flexibility than inheritance.
