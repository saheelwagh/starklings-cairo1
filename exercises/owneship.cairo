// Cairo is a language built around a linear type system that allows us
//  to statically ensure that in every Cairo program, 
//  a value is used exactly once. 
//  This linear type system helps preventing runtime errors by 
//  ensuring that operations that could cause such errors, 
//  such as writing twice to a memory cell, 
//  are detected at compile time. 
//  This is achieved by implementing an ownership system and 
//  forbidding copying and dropping values by default.
